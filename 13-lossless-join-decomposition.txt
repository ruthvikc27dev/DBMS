Lossless Join Decomposition 
- When natural joined the decomposed relations, the records should be exactly same as original relation.


Ex 1 -

R(A, B, C)
1 1 1
2 1 2
3 2 1
4 3 2


R1(A, B)
1 1
2 1
3 2
4 3

R2(B, C)
1 1
1 2
2 1
3 2

R1 natural join R2 -
A B C
1 1 1
1 1 2
2 1 1
2 1 2
3 2 1
4 3 2

Not as same as original records
So this is not Lossless Join Decomposition

- All the attributes in the decomposed relations should be same the original relation.
- Natural join should be possible
- Common attribute must be a super key or candidate key for atleast 1 decomposed relation

Ex 2 -
R(A, B, C)
1 1 1
2 1 2
3 2 1
4 3 2

R(A, B)
1 1
2 1
3 2
4 3

R(A, C)
1 1
2 2
3 1
4 2
