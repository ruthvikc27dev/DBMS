A relation is in BCNF if
    - It is in 3rd Normal form.
    - For each non-trivial FD X->Y, X must be super key.

Ex 1 -
R(A, B, C)
FD - {A->B, B->C, C->A}

ABC+ = {A, B, C} (SK)
AC+  = {A, B, C} (SK)
A+   = {A, B, C} (CK)
C+   = {A, B, C} (CK)
B+   = {A, B, C} (CK)

Checking FD
A->B (A is a super key)
B->C (B is a super key)
C->A (C is a super key)

So, the relation is in BCNF form.

Ex 2 -
R(A, B, C, D, E)
FD - {A->BCDE, BC->ACE, D->E}


Ex 3 -
R(A, B, C, D, E)
FD - {AB->CDE, D->A}
