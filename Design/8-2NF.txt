- Partial dependency 
    1. Proper subset of CK -> Non prime attribute
    2. Prime attribute -> Non prime attribute

A relational table is in 2nd Normal form -
    - It is in 1NF
    - No partial dependency in the relation

Ex 1 - 
R(A, B, C, D, E, F)
FD = { A->B, B->C, C->D, D->E }

ABCDEF+ = { A, B, C, D, E }
B, C, D, E can be discarded. (Transitivity rule)

AF is a candidate key.

Proper subset = {A, F}

F is not determining any other attribute

A is determining B which is partial dependency.

Ex 2 -
R(A, B, C, D)
FD = { AB->CD, C->A, D->B }

Ex 3 -
R(A, B, C, D)
FD = { A->B, B->C, C->D }

ABCD+ = {A, B, C, D}
B, C, D can be discarded (Transitivity rule)

A+ = { A, B, C, D }

A is a super key & candidate key

Proper subset of A is "fi"

So there is no partial dependency in this relation

Ex 4 -
R(A, B, C, D)
FD = { A->B, B->D }

ABCD+ = { A, B, C, D}
B, D can be discarded (Transitivity rule)

AC+ { A, B, C, D }

Proper subset AC is {A, C}

A->B which is non prime attribute.

So, partial dependency exists in this relation.
