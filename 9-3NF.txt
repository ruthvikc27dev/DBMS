Tranitive dependency -
Non prime attribute -> Non prime attribute

A Relation is in 3rd Normal form, if
- it is in 2nd Normal form
- there is no tranitive dependency


For non-prime attributes -
A table is in 3NF if and only if for each of its non-trivial functional
dependency at least one of the following conditions holds -
- LHS is Super key
- RHS is prime attribute


Ex 1 -
R(A, B, C, D)
FD - (A->B, B->C, C->D)

ABCD+ = {A, B, C, D}
B, C, D can be discarded (Tranitivity rule)

A+ = { A, B, C, D }

Proper subset of A is "fi"

"A" is not on the right side of functional dependencies,
so one candidate is only possible

B (NPA) -> C (NPA)  
C (NPA) -> D (NPA) 
So, Tranitive dependency exists.
Relation is not in 3rd normal form

Ex 2 -
R(A, B, C, D, E, F)
FD - {AB-> CDEF, BD->F}

ABCDEF+ = {A, B, C, D, E, F}
C, D, E, F can be discarded

AB+ = {A, B, C, D, E, F}

Proper subset of AB cannot determine all other attributes

No AB on the right sides

So only one CK is possible

Check for tranitive dependency.
AB -> CDEF (OK)
BD -> F    (Voilating) BD is considered as NPA


If database in 3rd normal form, then it is a good database design and adequate

Ex 3 -

R(A, B, C, D, E)
FD = { A->B, B->C, C->D, D->A }
