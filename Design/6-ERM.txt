What is an Entity Relationship Diagram?
- An Entity-Relationship Diagram describes the Relationship of entities that need to be stored in a database
- ER Diagram is mainly a structual design for the database. It is a framework using specialized symbols to define the relationship between entities.
- ER Diagram is created based on three main components entities, attributes, and relationships.

Why use Entity Relationship Diagram?
- Helps us conceptualize the database and help us know which fields need to be embedded for a particular entity.
- ER Diagram gives a better understanding of the information to be stored in a database.
- Reduces complexity and saves time whoch allows you to build databases quickly.
- Helps to describe elements using ER Model.

Symbols used in ER Diagram -
- Rectangle                         -    Entity
- Rectangle embedded in Rectangle   -    Weak Entity
- Oval (text underlined)            -    Key attribute
- Oval                              -    Attribute
- Dotted oval                       -    Derived attribute
- Oval embedded in oval             -    Multivalued attribute
- Diamond                           -    Relationship

Components in ER Diagram -
- Entity
    - Weak entity
- Attribute
    - Key
    - Composite
    - Multivalued
    - Derived
- Relationship
    - One to One
    - One to Many
    - Many to One
    - Many to Many

Entity
    - An entity can be either living or non living component
    - An entity is showcased as a rectangle in an ER diagram.

Weak entity 
    - In a relational database, a weak entity is an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone; therefore, it must use a foreign key in conjunction with its attributes to create a primary key.    

Attribute 
    - An attribute describes the property of an entity.
    - An attribute is represented as Oval in an ER diagram.

Key attribute 
    - Key attribute uniquely identifies an entity from an entity set.
    - The text of key attribute is underlined.

Composite attribute
    - An attribute that is composed of other attributes is known as composite attribute.
    - The composite attribute is represented with an oval, and that attribute is further connected with other ovals.

Multivalued attribute 
    - An attribute that can possess more than one value, such attributes are called Multivalued attributes.
    - The double oval is used to represent a Multivalued attribute.

Derived attribute 
    - An attribute that can be extracted from other attributes of the entity is known as Derived attribute.
    - In ER diagram, Derived attribute is represented by dashed oval.
